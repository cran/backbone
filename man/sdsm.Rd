\title{The stochastic degree sequence model (sdsm)}
\usage{
sdsm(B, trials = 1000, model = "logit", sparse = TRUE,
  maxiter = 25, dyad = NULL, progress = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{Matrix: Bipartite network}

\item{trials}{Integer: Number of random bipartite graphs generated}

\item{model}{String: A generalized linear model (glm) used to generate random bipartite graphs.}

\item{sparse}{Boolean: If sparse matrix manipulations should be used}

\item{maxiter}{Integer: Maximum number of iterations if "model" is a glm.}

\item{dyad}{vector length 2: two row entries i,j. Saves each value of the i-th row and j-th column in each projected B* matrix. This is useful for visualizing an example of the empirical null edge weight distribution generated by the model. These correspond to the row and column indices of a cell in the projected matrix , and can be written as their string row names or as numeric values.}

\item{progress}{Boolean: If \link[utils]{txtProgressBar} should be used to measure progress}
}
\value{
list(positive, negative, dyad_values).
positive: matrix of proportion of times each entry of the projected matrix B is above the corresponding entry in the generated projection.
negative: matrix of proportion of times each entry of the projected matrix B is below the corresponding entry in the generated projection.
dyad_values: list of edge weight for i,j in each generated projection.
}
\description{
`sdsm` computes the proportion of generated edges
    above or below the observed value using the stochastic degree sequence model.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return
    the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
}
\details{
The 'model' parameter can take in a 'link' function, as described by \link[stats]{glm} and \link[stats]{family}. This can be one of c('logit', 'probit', 'cauchit', 'log', 'cloglog').

During each iteration, sdsm computes a new B* matrix. This is a random bipartite matrix with about the same row and column sums as the original matrix B.
If the dyad_parameter is indicated to be used in the parameters, when the B* matrix is projected, the projected value for the corresponding row and column will be saved.
This allows the user to see the distribution of the edge weights for desired row and column.
